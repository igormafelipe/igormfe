        'confessions' : "The Confessions is a spiritual autobiography, covering the first 35 years of Augustine's life, with particular emphasis on Augustine's spiritual development and how he accepted Christianity. This book brought me back to Christianity after being 5 years away from the church, and having an unbalanced spiritual life. This book helped me understand what I already knew: while I do not agree with everything the church does and preaches, I can still take the best out of Christianity.",
        'harrypotter' : "I have always been in love with fantasy worlds and stories. Harry Potter and the Phylosopher's Stone was the first book I read in English, and even though I could not fully understand the book back then, I still fell in love with it. I proceeded to watch and read everything related to Harry Potter, and it was a big part of my childhood.",
        'casmurro' : "A retired, aristocratic lawyer writes a jaded and ironic account of his teenage courtship, marriage, and later abandonment of his apparently unfaithful wife. I was asked to read this book back in middle school, and I remember hating every second of it. I did not understand any of the plot, and was only interested in fantasy back then. I have recently given this book another shot, and it is amazing. The book hooks you in a plot filled with mistery, and all you can do is guess. The end Dom Casmurro is left for the reader to interpret, and it is very fun to discuss what you think happened.",

        'avatar' : "This was the first 3D movie I watched with my father back in 2009. The theater had oversold tickets, and my dad and I had to sit on the stairs. We did not mind. In fact, we had an even better view of the screen. I vividly remember seeing the ashes of the burning tree falling in front of my dad and I, and we were both dumbfolded. How was that possible? It was a trully magical moment.",
        'greenmile' : 'Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) walked the mile with a variety of cons. He had never encountered someone like John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a massive black man convicted of brutally killing a pair of young sisters. Coffey had the size and strength to kill anyone, but not the demeanor. Beyond his simple, naive nature and a deathly fear of the dark, Coffey seemed to possess a prodigious, supernatural gift. Paul began to question whether Coffey was truly guilty of murdering the two girls.',

        'witcher' : 'Witcher follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, who struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than monsters and beasts.',
        'arcane' : 'League of Legends has been a big part of my life, and to see its universe animated is mind blowing. Despite my bias towards the animation, trust me, this is a must watch. Riot Games went all out, and created a great art style, with a good plot and amazing music.',

        'naruto' : 'Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tails attacked Konohagakure destroying much of the village and taking many lives. The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children — taking their cues from their parents — inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.',
